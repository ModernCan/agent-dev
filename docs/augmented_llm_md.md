# Augmented LLM: The Building Block of Agentic Systems

An Augmented LLM is the fundamental building block for all agent-based systems. This component enhances a standard Large Language Model with additional capabilities that allow it to interact more effectively with the world and produce more structured responses.

## Key Capabilities

Augmented LLMs extend base LLM functionality with:

1. **Structured Output** - Forces the LLM to format its responses according to a predefined schema
2. **Tool Integration** - Gives the LLM the ability to call external functions and APIs
3. **Memory** - Allows the LLM to maintain state across interactions (not shown in our example code)

## Why Use Augmented LLMs?

Regular LLMs produce free-form text. This is perfect for conversational interfaces but presents challenges when:

- You need the output to follow a specific format
- You want the LLM to take actions in the world (like searching, calculating, or accessing databases)
- You need the LLM to refer to past interactions

Augmentation addresses these limitations, making LLMs more suitable for programmatic use.

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation provides a clean interface for adding these capabilities:

```python
augmented_llm = AugmentedLLM()

# Add structured output capability
structured_llm = augmented_llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
output = structured_llm.invoke("How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?")

# Add tool-usage capability
llm_with_tools = augmented_llm.with_tools([multiply])
response = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 times 3?")
```

## Benefits of Structured Output

Structured output:
- Ensures consistent response formatting
- Makes it easier to validate and process LLM outputs
- Helps the LLM understand exactly what information you need
- Enables programmatic handling of responses

## Benefits of Tool Integration

Tool integration:
- Extends the LLM's capabilities beyond text generation
- Allows the LLM to act on the world
- Compensates for the LLM's limitations (like calculation errors)
- Creates a foundation for more complex agent patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Design clear schemas** - Make your output schemas intuitive with descriptive field names
2. **Document tools well** - Include detailed docstrings that explain exactly what each tool does
3. **Validate inputs/outputs** - Use Pydantic to ensure data validation at runtime
4. **Start simple** - Begin with these basic augmentations before moving to more complex patterns

## When to Use

Augmented LLMs are appropriate when:
- You need consistent, structured responses
- Your application requires the LLM to take specific actions
- You're building a foundation for more complex agent systems

This pattern is the simplest form of LLM enhancement and should be your starting point before adding more complex behavior like multi-step workflows or autonomous agents.

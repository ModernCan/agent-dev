# Routing: Intelligent Classification and Specialization

Routing is a powerful pattern that classifies input and directs it to specialized handlers, enabling more targeted and effective responses.

## Concept

The routing pattern involves:

1. Analyzing an input to determine its category or type
2. Directing the input to a specialized handler optimized for that category
3. Processing the input with category-specific prompting and tools
4. Returning the specialized result

This approach is similar to a customer service system that routes different types of inquiries to the appropriate department specialists.

## When to Use Routing

Routing is ideal when:

- Input can fall into clearly distinguishable categories
- Different categories benefit from specialized handling
- You want to optimize prompts for specific tasks
- Response quality improves with specialization

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation uses an LLM to classify inputs and route them to specialized handlers:

1. **Router**: An LLM with structured output that classifies the input
2. **Specialized Handlers**:
   - Story Writer: Optimized for narrative creation
   - Joke Writer: Specialized for humor
   - Poem Writer: Focused on poetic composition

```python
# Routing schema definition
class Route(BaseModel):
    step: Literal["poem", "story", "joke"] = Field(
        None, description="The next step in the routing process"
    )

# Router implementation
def route_input(state):
    decision = router.invoke([
        SystemMessage(content="Route the input to story, joke, or poem based on the user's request."),
        HumanMessage(content=state["input"]),
    ])
    return {"decision": decision.step}

# Conditional edge function
def route_decision(state):
    if state["decision"] == "story":
        return "write_story"
    elif state["decision"] == "joke":
        return "write_joke"
    elif state["decision"] == "poem":
        return "write_poem"
```

## Advantages

1. **Specialized Processing**: Each handler can use optimized prompts
2. **Improved Quality**: Specialization leads to better results
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns between classification and handling
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new handlers for additional categories
5. **Maintainability**: Updates to one handler don't affect others

## Disadvantages

1. **Classification Errors**: Incorrect routing leads to suboptimal results
2. **Overhead**: Additional step for classification adds latency
3. **Binary Decisions**: Some inputs may span multiple categories
4. **Complexity**: More components to build and maintain

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Categories**: Define distinct, non-overlapping categories
2. **Robust Classification**: Use clear prompting and structured output for reliable routing
3. **Specialized Handlers**: Optimize each handler for its specific category
4. **Default Route**: Include a fallback handler for ambiguous cases
5. **Feedback Loop**: Monitor classification accuracy and refine the router over time

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Hierarchical Routing

For complex domains, implement multi-level routing:
- First level: Determine the general category
- Second level: Classify within sub-categories

### 2. Confidence-Based Routing

Add confidence scores to routing decisions:
- High confidence: Route directly to specialized handler
- Low confidence: Route to a more general handler
- Very low confidence: Request clarification

### 3. Multi-Modal Routing

Route not just based on content but also:
- Input format (text, code, data)
- Complexity
- Language
- Tone requirements

## Real-World Applications

Routing is valuable for:

- Customer support systems
- Educational content generation
- Multi-functional assistant applications
- Content moderation
- Specialized search systems

By implementing routing, you can build systems that combine the breadth of general AI capabilities with the depth of specialized expertise, leading to more effective and precise responses across diverse domains.

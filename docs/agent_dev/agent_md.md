# Agent: Autonomous Problem Solving Through Tools and Reasoning

An Agent is the most autonomous and flexible pattern in LLM applications, capable of planning, taking actions through tool use, and adapting based on feedback in a continuous loop.

## Concept

Unlike more structured workflows, agents:

1. Dynamically determine their own actions rather than following predefined steps
2. Choose which tools to use and when, rather than being directed by code
3. Interpret and respond to feedback from the environment
4. Maintain an ongoing cycle of reasoning, action, and adaptation

This approach creates flexible, autonomous systems that can tackle open-ended problems where the exact solution path can't be predetermined.

## When to Use Agents

The agent pattern is ideal when:

- Problems require flexible, multi-step reasoning
- The optimal sequence of actions depends on intermediate results
- You need the system to adapt to unexpected situations
- Tasks involve multiple potential tools and decision points
- Users need to interact with a system over multiple turns

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation creates an arithmetic agent that can perform calculations:

1. **Main Loop**: The agent continuously cycles between thinking and acting
2. **Tool Integration**: The agent has access to arithmetic tools (add, multiply, divide)
3. **Action Selection**: The agent autonomously decides which tools to use when
4. **Termination Logic**: The agent determines when to stop and provide a final answer

```python
# Build agent
agent_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Add nodes
agent_builder.add_node("llm_call", llm_call)
agent_builder.add_node("tool_executor", tool_executor)

# Connect with continuation logic
agent_builder.add_edge(START, "llm_call")
agent_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "llm_call",
    should_continue,
    {
        "Action": "tool_executor",
        END: END,
    },
)
agent_builder.add_edge("tool_executor", "llm_call")
```

## Key Components

### 1. Tool Definition

Tools are the agent's interface with the world, defined with clear schemas:

```python
@tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply a and b."""
    return a * b
```

### 2. Action Selection

The agent must decide whether to use tools or provide a final answer:

```python
def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["Action", str]:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "Action"
    return END
```

### 3. Tool Execution

The agent's selected tools are executed in the environment:

```python
def tool_executor(state: MessagesState) -> Dict[str, List]:
    result = []
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
        observation = tool.invoke(tool_call["args"])
        result.append(ToolMessage(content=str(observation), tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]))
    return {"messages": result}
```

## Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: Adapts to unexpected situations and novel problems
2. **Autonomy**: Requires less hardcoded logic and predetermined paths
3. **Extensibility**: New tools can be added without restructuring the agent
4. **Interactive Problem Solving**: Can engage in multi-turn interaction when needed
5. **Complex Reasoning**: Can decompose complex problems into manageable steps

## Disadvantages

1. **Unpredictability**: Less deterministic than structured workflows
2. **Potential for Loops**: May get stuck in reasoning cycles
3. **Resource Intensity**: Often requires more LLM calls than simpler patterns
4. **Complex Debugging**: Harder to diagnose and fix issues
5. **Tool Reliability**: Depends on the agent correctly using tools

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Tool Documentation**: Provide explicit descriptions and examples for each tool
2. **Task-Specific System Prompts**: Guide the agent with clear instructions
3. **Thoughtful Tool Design**: Create tools that are reliable and easy to use correctly
4. **Safety Guardrails**: Implement limits on iterations and resource usage
5. **Structured Reasoning**: Encourage step-by-step thinking in your prompts

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Memory and Context Management

Implement strategies to handle context limitations:
- Summarization of past interactions
- Selective attention to relevant information
- External memory storage for large contexts

### 2. ReAct Prompting

Explicitly structure the agent's thinking:
- Reasoning: Analysis of the current situation
- Action: Selection of a tool to use
- Observation: Interpreting the result of the action

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

Add human touchpoints for complex decisions:
- Verification of critical steps
- Providing clarification when the agent is uncertain
- Redirecting when the agent gets stuck

## Real-World Applications

The agent pattern is valuable for:

- Customer support assistants
- Research assistants that gather and synthesize information
- Coding assistants that break down and implement complex features
- Data analysis workflows requiring multiple tools and techniques
- Personal assistants managing complex multi-step tasks

By implementing the agent pattern, you can create systems that combine the reasoning power of LLMs with the structured capabilities of tools, enabling autonomous problem-solving for complex, open-ended tasks.

# Prompt Chaining: Sequential LLM Calls for Complex Tasks

Prompt chaining is a powerful pattern for decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of simpler LLM calls, where each step builds on the results of the previous one.

## Concept

Rather than asking an LLM to perform a complex task in a single call, prompt chaining:

1. Breaks the task into a sequence of smaller steps
2. Uses separate LLM calls for each step
3. Passes information between steps
4. Includes quality checks to ensure each step meets requirements

This approach is analogous to an assembly line, where each station performs a specialized function, resulting in a higher-quality final product.

## When to Use Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining is ideal when:

- A task can be naturally broken down into discrete sequential steps
- The quality of each step impacts the next step's performance
- Intermediate validation is valuable
- You want to trade latency for higher accuracy

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation orchestrates a three-step joke creation process:

1. **Generate**: Create an initial joke about a topic
2. **Improve**: Enhance the joke with wordplay
3. **Polish**: Add a surprising twist

Between steps 1 and 2, we include a quality check to ensure the joke has a punchline.

```python
workflow = StateGraph(JokeState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("generate_joke", generate_joke)
workflow.add_node("improve_joke", improve_joke)
workflow.add_node("polish_joke", polish_joke)

# Connect nodes with quality check
workflow.add_edge(START, "generate_joke")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate_joke", 
    check_punchline, 
    {"Pass": "improve_joke", "Fail": END}
)
workflow.add_edge("improve_joke", "polish_joke")
workflow.add_edge("polish_joke", END)
```

## Advantages

1. **Improved Quality**: Each step focuses on a specific aspect of the task
2. **Error Reduction**: Quality checks catch issues early
3. **Transparency**: The workflow and intermediate results are visible
4. **Modularity**: Steps can be independently improved or replaced
5. **Simplified Prompting**: Each prompt can be specific and targeted

## Disadvantages

1. **Increased Latency**: Multiple sequential LLM calls take more time
2. **Higher Cost**: Multiple calls cost more than a single call
3. **Error Propagation**: Early errors can impact later steps
4. **Complex Implementation**: More code to manage the workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Decomposition**: Break the task into logical steps that build on each other
2. **Quality Gates**: Include validation between steps to catch errors early
3. **Smart Routing**: Skip unnecessary steps when appropriate
4. **Graceful Failure**: Handle cases where a step fails to meet quality standards
5. **Transparent State**: Make the intermediate state accessible for debugging

## Real-World Applications

Prompt chaining is valuable for tasks like:

- Content creation with reviews and improvements
- Multi-step reasoning processes
- Document generation with planning and drafting stages
- Translation with verification and refinement
- Report generation with research, analysis, and synthesis phases

By implementing prompt chaining, you can create more reliable and higher-quality LLM applications that handle complex tasks more effectively than single-prompt approaches.

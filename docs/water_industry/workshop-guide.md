- **Visual Explanations**: Use diagrams to illustrate how patterns work
- **Real-World Parallels**: Compare AI patterns to familiar utility processes

### Effective Demonstrations

- **Keep It Simple**: Focus on clear inputs and outputs rather than code details
- **Highlight Key Elements**: Call attention to specific pattern characteristics
- **Show Practical Results**: Emphasize the quality and usefulness of outputs
- **Prepare Backup Examples**: Have alternative demos ready in case of technical issues

### Encouraging Participation

- **Domain Knowledge Validation**: Ask participants to validate the relevance of examples
- **Challenge Identification**: Have them share specific challenges they face
- **Success Criteria Definition**: Discuss what would make an AI implementation valuable
- **Risk Assessment**: Openly discuss concerns and implementation challenges

## Follow-Up Materials

After the workshop, provide participants with:

1. **Educational Guides**: The markdown files explaining each pattern
2. **Case Studies**: Detailed descriptions of the water industry implementations
3. **Assessment Template**: A framework for evaluating AI readiness at their utility
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Suggested steps for moving forward

## Additional Resources

### AI Readiness Assessment Questions

1. What data do you currently collect that could be valuable for AI applications?
2. Where do you spend significant staff time on repetitive analytical tasks?
3. What decisions require analyzing multiple sources of information?
4. Where could improved prediction or optimization create significant value?
5. What aspects of your operations have high consequence for mistakes?

### Pattern Selection Guide

Provide a simple decision tree to help participants select appropriate patterns:

- **If the task involves sequential steps of analysis** → Consider Prompt Chaining
- **If the task requires examining multiple aspects simultaneously** → Consider Parallelization
- **If you need to direct different types of requests to specialists** → Consider Routing
- **If you need coordinated action across multiple departments** → Consider Orchestrator-Worker
- **If you need to iteratively improve a process until goals are met** → Consider Evaluator-Optimizer

### Technology Infrastructure Checklist

1. **Data Availability**: What data sources would need to be connected?
2. **Integration Points**: What systems would the AI need to interact with?
3. **Security Requirements**: What data protection measures are needed?

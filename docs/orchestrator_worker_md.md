# Orchestrator-Worker: Dynamic Task Planning and Delegation

The Orchestrator-Worker pattern is a sophisticated approach where a central orchestrator LLM dynamically plans a task, delegates subtasks to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results into a coherent final output.

## Concept

The Orchestrator-Worker pattern implements a coordination structure:

1. **Orchestrator Phase**: A specialized LLM analyzes the task and creates a dynamic plan
2. **Delegation Phase**: The plan is divided into subtasks assigned to worker LLMs 
3. **Execution Phase**: Workers complete their assigned subtasks independently
4. **Synthesis Phase**: Results from all workers are combined into a cohesive final product

This pattern resembles a project manager breaking down a complex project, assigning tasks to team members, and integrating their work into a final deliverable.

## When to Use Orchestrator-Worker

This pattern is ideal when:

- Tasks have unknown or variable numbers of subtasks
- The structure of the task depends on the specific input
- Parallelization would improve efficiency
- Subtasks are too complex for a single prompt but share common patterns
- Quality improves when results are integrated by a central coordinator

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation creates a comprehensive report generation system:

1. **Orchestrator** (Planning): Analyzes the topic and determines necessary report sections
2. **Workers** (Execution): Each writes a different section based on assigned specifications
3. **Synthesizer** (Integration): Combines all sections into a cohesive final report

The system handles the dynamic assignment of sections using LangGraph's `Send` API:

```python
def assign_workers(state: ReportState) -> List[Send]:
    """Assign a worker to each section in the plan"""
    # Kick off section writing in parallel via Send() API
    return [Send("worker", {"section": s}) for s in state["sections"]]
```

## Advantages

1. **Dynamic Planning**: Adapts to the specific requirements of each input
2. **Parallelization**: Executes subtasks concurrently for efficiency
3. **Specialization**: Each worker can focus on a specific part of the task
4. **Scalability**: Handles complex tasks with variable numbers of subtasks
5. **Integration Quality**: Final synthesis ensures coherence across components

## Disadvantages

1. **Complexity**: More complex to implement than simpler patterns
2. **Coordination Overhead**: Additional steps for planning and synthesis
3. **Consistency Challenges**: Maintaining consistent style/approach across workers
4. **Resource Intensity**: Running multiple LLM calls increases resource usage

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Decomposition**: The orchestrator should create well-defined, independent subtasks
2. **Efficient Communication**: Provide workers with only the information they need
3. **Parallel Execution**: Leverage concurrent processing whenever possible
4. **Quality Synthesis**: Invest in making the final integration seamless
5. **Error Handling**: Implement strategies for handling failures in individual workers

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Hierarchical Orchestration

For very complex tasks, implement multi-level orchestration:
- Top-level orchestrator for overall planning
- Sub-orchestrators for specific components
- Workers at the bottom level

### 2. Adaptive Resource Allocation

Assign more capable models to more complex subtasks:
- Use smaller models for simple, structured tasks
- Use more powerful models for creative or complex reasoning

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Add feedback loops where the orchestrator:
- Reviews worker outputs
- Provides feedback
- Requests revisions when necessary

## Real-World Applications

The Orchestrator-Worker pattern is valuable for:

- Comprehensive report generation
- Research synthesis across multiple sources
- Multi-section document creation
- Complex software development tasks
- Project planning and execution

By implementing this pattern, you can tackle tasks that are too complex or varied for simpler workflows, while maintaining efficiency through parallelization and ensuring coherence through centralized planning and synthesis.
